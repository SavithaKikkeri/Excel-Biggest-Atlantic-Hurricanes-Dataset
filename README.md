# Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes Dataset

This dataset contains information about the most significant Atlantic hurricanes recorded from 1870 to 2017. It includes key details about each hurricane, such as name, start date, damage in USD millions, Saffir-Simpson category, and maximum wind speed.

## Dataset Columns

- **Name** – The name of the hurricane.
- **Start Date** – The date when the hurricane started.
- **Damage (USD Millions)** – Estimated economic damage caused by the hurricane in millions of US dollars.
- **Category** – Saffir-Simpson hurricane category (1–5), indicating hurricane intensity.
- **Max Wind Speed** – Maximum sustained wind speed in miles per hour (mph).

## Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale

| Category | Max Wind Speed (mph) |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1        | 95–110             |
| 2        | 111–129            |
| 3        | 130–156            |
| 4        | 157–184            |
| 5        | 157 and over       |

> Note: Wind speeds for categories 4 and 5 sometimes overlap in historical records due to measurement differences.

## Key Insights

- The dataset captures both historical and modern hurricanes.
- Economic damages range from minor impacts (1 million USD) to catastrophic events (300,000 million USD, e.g., Hurricane Irma in 2017).
- Several hurricanes reached Category 5, the highest intensity level.
- Dates show that hurricanes have been consistently impacting the Atlantic region over the past 150+ years.
